# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Course Project

This repository was created and by Anson Quadros and submitted for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project for Coursera. Instructions below provide how to run the analysis on the Human Activity recognition Dataset. 

## Dataset obtained from: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Files created for this project: 

- Codebook.md :- A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

- run_analysis.R :- This script includes the necessary steps taken in order to obtain data and clean it using the 5 steps as asked from the project description. 
                    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
                    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
                    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- FinalData.txt :- The exported clean data obtained after going through all the steps above.
